Exercise 2 — Borders & Backgrounds

Goal:
Create a profile card with border radius, a background image, and a white overlay for text readability.

Assets:
• assets_user_photo.png — use this image as the background of the card.

Tasks for students (write ONLY CSS, do not change HTML structure):
1) Style .card with a rounded border (10px radius).
2) Set the card's background-image to assets_user_photo.png. Ensure the image covers the card.
3) Create a readable white overlay behind the text using rgba() (e.g., rgba(255,255,255,0.85)).
   You can use the existing .overlay element to apply the semi-transparent background.
4) Add any sensible padding/margins via CSS to make the text comfortable to read.

Notes:
• Use background-position and background-size as needed (e.g., center/cover).
• Keep all changes in CSS only. Do not alter the HTML elements or their order.
